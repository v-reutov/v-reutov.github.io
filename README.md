Hello, visitors. Turn away if you want to, zero intresting stuff ahead...

For those who stayed - well, you have nothing else to do, don't you ;)

This is just my studying project slightly connected to my course paper. Here i will test some features to learn web development using JS or Dart. Or something else.

Actually I have nothing more to say for now. If you are intrested in what this project could become, feel free to visit it from time to time, but not too frequently (cause then you don't notice anything new).

Thank you for reading this boring text if you are accomplished it :)
